# Digit-Identification-Keras-CNN

In this project I built a convolutional neural network model used to predict digits from house number photos.  Keras and Tensorflow libraries are used to create the model.

Thus far, the model's highest validation accuracy has been 79%.  The more typical validation set accuracy, however, is 60%.

The house number photos are from Stanford University's The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset.  Please find the link to this dataset, as well as more information about it, [here](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/).
